/**
 * Extension of {@link com.acuo.persist.repository.Repository Repository}
 * allowing filtering it's contents to get a subset of them.
 * <p>
 * The methods added by this interface allow finding concrete sets of entities,
 * or a single concrete one, through the use of a filter.
 * <p>
 * The filter can be any type of class, but it should serve to differentiate
 * entities in some way.
 * <p>
 * A predicate which the entities must make true, or an SQL query are examples
 * of such filters, but what the interface uses, and how, will depend purely on
 * the implementation.
